level01|level01.dad-meet:17, @E2210042, "The Emerald has been lost for so long."
level01|level01.dad-meet:18, @E52104FB, "If I could just find it, it would fix everything!"
level01|level01.dad-meet:19, @E4210368, "{@you}  Wait... fix what? What do you mean?"
level01|level01.dad-meet:20, @6B198928, "{@dad}  Sorry, Jules, no time to talk. I've got work to do!"

level01|level01.lou-meet:10, @B031A3CE, "{@you} \tLooks like a shipwreck!"
level01|level01.lou-meet:11, @B131A561, "{@lou} \tAwesome! I thought it might be."
level01|level01.lou-meet:12, @AE31A0A8, "It's in Lake Michigan, near Rawley Point."

level01|level01.amy-meet:3, @A0011BB3, "Lou clued me in on the dive. How was it?"
level01|level01.amy-meet:4, @A5012392, "{@you}  Beautiful! The ship was in great condition. No mussels or plant life."
level01|level01.amy-meet:5, @A6012525, "{@amy}  Hmmm. It must've been covered up in sand until now."
level01|level01.amy-meet:6, @A301206C, "{@you}  The shipwreck was near Rawley Point."

level01|level01.amy-article:17, @31A77583, "{@amy}  It was the captain's. Sounds like it went down with the ship."
level01|level01.amy-article:18, @3EA789FA, "{@you}  Hmm. I should dive again. Maybe it's still down there."

level01|level01.lou-complete:12, @96D4EDD8, "The sailors had to climb up into the rigging. Luckily, they were rescued by a fishing boat."
level01|level01.lou-complete:13, @97D4EF6B, "{@lou}\tWow! What a wild story."

level02|level02.dive-safe:2, @763BD2FD, "{@you}   No way, Reya. It's illegal to take anything without a permit."
level02|level02.dive-safe:3, @753BD16A, "{@reya}\tUgh. You are SO BORING. I can't believe we're related."

level02|level02.amy-match:5, @AD177A6D, "It's a freighter near Port Washington. It was carrying old cars."
level02|level02.amy-match:7, @AB177747, "{@amy}  Hmm. Looks like two freighters sank in that area with cars onboard."
level02|level02.amy-match:8, @A01765F6, "One with Kissel cars, and one with Nash cars."
level02|level02.amy-match:9, @A1176789, "They used to be made here in Wisconsin!"

level02|level02.cooper-meet:8, @BFBE4BA1, "{@cooper}     It's funny. You've got the same last name as the captain who caused that awful shipwreck."
level02|level02.cooper-meet:9, @BEBE4A0E, "{@you}\tUm, yeah. I know."
level02|level02.cooper-meet:10, @F37A7532, "Wait... did you say the captain CAUSED the shipwreck?"
level02|level02.cooper-meet:11, @F47A76C5, "{@cooper}\tThat's right. It was a local legend when I was a kid."
level02|level02.cooper-meet:12, @F17A720C, "The steel company that owned the ship said it was in great condition. The strongest freighter on the lake!"
level02|level02.cooper-meet:13, @F27A739F, "But the captain took it out in a terrible storm."
level02|level02.cooper-meet:14, @EF7A6EE6, "If only he'd been more careful."
level02|level02.cooper-meet:15, @F07A7079, "{@you} Wow. I had no idea."

level02|level02.reya-safe:3, @8036DFED, "{@reya}\tCool. I solved a mystery too."
level02|level02.reya-safe:5, @7A36D67B, "{@you}\tWhat?! Reya, how did you get that safe?"
level02|level02.reya-safe:6, @7B36D80E, "{@reya}\tThe guy who hired me got a permit to bring it up!"
level02|level02.reya-safe:7, @7C36D9A1, "It's just a bunch of nickels and an old alarm clock. I was hoping for gold."
level02|level02.reya-safe:8, @7536CE9C, "But they're gonna display it at a museum, with my name on it!"
level02|level02.reya-safe:10, @A75DD8D5, "What about the Madison? I wanna know how it sank!"
level02|level02.reya-safe:11, @A65DD742, "{@you}  Fine. Let's see..."
level02|level02.reya-safe:12, @A55DD5AF, "It was a super foggy day—the same day the stock market crashed and started the Great Depression."
level02|level02.reya-safe:13, @A45DD41C, "The Madison was carrying 268 Wisconsin-made Nash cars to Detroit."
level02|level02.reya-safe:14, @A35DD289, "All of a sudden, another freighter appeared in the fog."
level02|level02.reya-safe:15, @A25DD0F6, "The ships were too close to avoid crashing. The SS Lookout rammed the Madison!"
level02|level02.reya-safe:16, @A15DCF63, "{@reya}  Ha. Biggest car wreck ever!"
level02|level02.reya-safe:17, @A05DCDD0, "{@you}\tThe captain of the Lookout panicked and headed to port, leaving the Madison behind."
level02|level02.reya-safe:18, @AF5DE56D, "Luckily, another ship came to help, but a bunch of people didn't survive."
level02|level02.reya-safe:19, @AE5DE3DA, "{@reya}  Wow. That's actually a great story."
level02|level02.reya-safe:20, @AD6020DE, "Super sad, though."
level02|level02.reya-safe:21, @AE602271, "I wonder if anybody saw it coming..."
level02|level02.dad-superior:1, @783AA569, "{@dad}\tHey, Jules. I've got a shipwreck for you to check out!"
level02|level02.dad-superior:3, @763AA243, "My fishing buddy pulled this up on Lake Michigan."
level02|level02.dad-superior:4, @7B3AAA22, "{@you}\tLooks like part of a sidewheel steamer!"
level02|level02.dad-superior:5, @7C3AABB5, "I'll talk to my mentor, Cami. She's an expert on those ships."
level02|level02.dad-superior:6, @793AA6FC, "Did you get the latitude and longitude?"
level02|level02.dad-superior:7, @7A3AA88F, "{@dad}\tYep. It's near Sheboygan."

level02|level02.dad-superior:10, @9D524B1B, "{@you}\tThanks, Dad."
level02|level02.dad-superior:11, @9C524988, "How's the new sonar?"
level02|level02.dad-superior:12, @9F524E41, "{@dad}   Uh... not so great."
level02|level02.dad-superior:13, @9E524CAE, "But I'm sure I'll figure it out. Eventually."
level02|level02.dad-superior:14, @A1525167, "I'm out on Lake Superior right now. Got my map with me."
level02|level02.dad-superior:16, @A352548D, "Your grandpa’s last planned route is marked in red."
level02|level02.dad-superior:17, @A25252FA, "The Emerald must be around here somewhere."
level02|level02.dad-superior:19, @94523CF0, "{@you} \tDad... why didn't you tell me the shipwreck was Grandpa's fault?"
level02|level02.dad-superior:20, @0B4AA980, "{@dad}  What?! Of course it wasn't his fault."
level02|level02.dad-superior:21, @0C4AAB13, "{@you}  The steel company said it was."
level02|level02.dad-superior:22, @0D4AACA6, "{@dad}  They just needed somebody to blame. How can you think that about your own grandpa?!"
level02|level02.dad-superior:23, @0E4AAE39, "{@you}  Well, you never talk about him! What was he like?"
level02|level02.dad-superior:24, @0F4AAFCC, "{@dad}  Never mind that, Jules."
level02|level02.dad-superior:25, @104AB15F, "We just need to find that ship. Then you'll see."
level03|level03.cami-meet:1, @BF4CF3BA, "{@cami}  Hey Jules! You need some info on a sidewheel steamer?"

level03|level03.cami-meet:12, @AE235F18, "People called these type of ships Palace Steamers, because they were so fancy."
level03|level03.cami-meet:13, @AF2360AB, "The manifest was lost, so the cargo is unknown."
