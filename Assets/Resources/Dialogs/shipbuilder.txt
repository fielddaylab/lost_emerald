Hey Rusty, you around?

them:
Nope.

us:
Ha. Funny.

us:
I'm trying to ID a wreck I just photographed. I narrowed it down to two possible canallers. The Loretta and the Timberland. Do you have any records that might help?

them:
Take a look at these two ship diagrams.

them:
Notice the brackets or "knees" they used to hold the ships together?

us:
Sure, those curved things.

them:
Yup. The Loretta had more angled brackets made of iron and the Timberland had more curved ones made of wood.

us:
Awesome, thanks!!
