Hey, Cooper! I’m looking into a wrecked car carrier.

us: 
It might’ve been carrying Nash or Kissel cars.

them: 
Wow, what a find! 

us: 
Can you send me some photos from your museum?

them: 
Welp, we’re all locked up for the night.

us: 
Oh. 

them: 
Good thing I’ve got the key!

them: 
Just a hot second...

them: 
[Sends a Nash car photo and a Kissel car photo]

us: 
This is perfect. Thanks, Cooper!
