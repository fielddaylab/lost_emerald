Hey Amy! 

us: 
I’m looking for info on the SS Madison.

us: 
Any clues about how it sank? 

them: 
Hmm, let’s see...

them: 
Ooh, I’ve got the ship’s distress call in our radio archives!

them: 
There’s also a call from the ship that helped rescue the sailors.

them: 
Sending them over now.

us: 
Thanks!
