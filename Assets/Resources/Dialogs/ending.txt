Hey Lou. The ship was the Loretta!

Ooh, awesome!

Also… I need to warn you about something.

Some shipwreck hunter keeps texting me. 

them:
She wants to find your grandpa’s ship.

us:
What? Why?? 

them:
She found an old letter of your grandpa’s. Check it out:

them:
Just arrived at the Twin Ports! Missing you dearly. Glad to have my treasure with me, as usual. It’s small, but it’s worth more than gold. With Love, Edward

us:
Whoa. My grandpa had treasure on his ship??

them:
Guess so. She said she’s gonna be the first one to find it.

us:
Ugh.

us:
Thanks, Lou.

No prob. Gotta go… I’m in the mood for a sundae. 🍨
