    {@reya}	Hey sis! Ready to go treasure hunting? 
	{@you}	I'm not a treasure hunter, Reya.
		My job is about history! Solving mysteries, uncovering lost stories... 
    {@reya}	Yaaaawn. Whatever floats your boat, I guess. 
    {@reya}	Anyway, the ship’s down there.
    {@reya}	Break a leg! Or a flipper, or whatever.

	{@reya}	Ugh. You are SO BORING. I can't believe we're related.

	{@amy}	Hey! Heard you went on a dive with your sister. 
		How’d it go?
	{@you}  Well.... she called me boring and tried to get me in trouble. 
		But we found an amazing wreck!
	        It's a freighter near Port Washington. It was carrying old cars.
	{@amy}  Hmm. Looks like two freighters sank out there with automobiles in the cargo hold. 
		One with Kissel cars, and one with Nash cars. 
		You'll need to figure out the cargo to identify the ship. 
		I'll have my friend at the auto museum call you. 
	{@you}	Thanks, Amy!

	{@cooper}	Hi there! Are you Amy’s friend?
	{@you}	Yep. I'm Jules Griffin.
			I'm trying to ID a shipwreck with an old car in the cargo hold. 
			Can you send me photos of Nash and Kissel brand cars? 
	{@cooper}	Of course! Just a minute...
			{obj ClassicCars}
	{@you}	Awesome, thanks!
			{/obj}
	{@cooper}     It's funny. You've got the same last name as the captain who caused that awful shipwreck. 
	{@you}	Oh. Haha, yeah. Funny. 
			Wait... did you say the captain CAUSED the shipwreck??
	{@cooper}	That's right. The company that owned the ship, O.K. Steel, did a report.
			They said Captain Griffin went out in bad weather.
	{@you} Wow. I had no idea. 
	       Thanks again, Cooper. 
	{@cooper}  Happy to help!

	{@reya}	Hey, sis! Figure out that ship? 
	{@you}	Actually, yes. The ship is the SS Madison!
	{@reya}	Cool. I solved a mystery too. 
			{img reya-safe}
	{@you}	What?! Reya, how did you get that safe?
	{@reya}	Ha. You're so jealous. It's adorable. 
		The guy who hired me got a permit to bring it up.
		It's an old alarm clock and a bunch of 1920s nickels!
		It's all going to a museum, though. Oh well. 
			{/img}
		So what about the Madison? I wanna know how she sank!
	{@you}  Fine. Let's see...
		It was a super foggy day, right before the Great Depression started. 
		The Madison was carrying a load of Wisconsin-made Nash cars to Detroit. 
	{@reya}  Ooh. Bet this doesn't end well.
	{@you}   Nope. All of a sudden, another freighter appeared in the fog.
		The ships were too close to avoid crashing. The SS Lookout rammed the Madison!
		The captain of the Lookout panicked and headed to port.
		Luckily, another ship came to help the Madison, but a bunch of people didn't survive.
	{@reya}  Wow. That's super sad. 
		All those awesome cars, stuck at the bottom of the lake. 
	{@you}  Um.... and the people, right?
	{@reya} Oh yeah. That too. 
		I wonder if anybody saw it coming...

	{@dad}	Hey, Jules! I've got a shipwreck for you to check out!
		{img broken-wheel}
		My buddy pulled this up in his nets on Lake Michigan.
	{@you}	Looks like a broken piece of a sidewheel steamer!
		I'll talk to my mentor, Cami. She's an expert on those ships. 
		Did you get the latitude and longitude? 
	{@dad}	Yep! It's near Sheboygan.
		Location: 43°42'08.6"N 87°38'26.0"W

		Jules?
	{@you} 	Dad, why didn't you tell me the shipwreck was Grandpa's fault?
	{@dad}  What?! Of course it wasn't his fault! 
	{@you}  The steel company said it was.
	{@dad}  They just needed somebody to blame. That's why I need to find the Emerald--to prove his innocence!
	{@you} I don't know, Dad. From your stories, it sounds like Grandpa could be pretty reckless--
	{@dad}  Oh, look at that! Sonar's working! Gotta go, Jules. Wish me luck!
