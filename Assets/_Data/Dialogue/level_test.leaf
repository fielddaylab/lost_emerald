	{@dad}  Hey, help me out with something.
			Did you leave behind your copy of Divine Dive Master of the Seven Seas? when you moved out?
	{@you}	That old game? I might have...
	{@dad}	Yeah! You played that game every day after school for like a year.
			You want it back?
	{@you}	I'll think on it.

	{@lou} 	Jules!! I was out flying by Rawley Point today and saw this: 
		   	{img birds-eye-photo-new}
	 		GPS coordinates: N 44° 11.524' W 087° 30.591'
	 		What do you think?
	{@you} 	Looks like a shipwreck!
	{@lou}	Yes!!! 
	{@you}	The storm last night must’ve uncovered it.
			Thanks, Lou!
	{@lou} 	No prob! 😎

	{@you}  What am I supposed to do with those coordinates you gave me?
	{@lou}  You can pin them to your evidence board to learn more about the wreck.
