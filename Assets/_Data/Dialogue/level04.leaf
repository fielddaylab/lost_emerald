		I need money to buy a sonar for my boat.
	{@you}	Dad, you don't even know how sonar works!
		And what about our family history?? 
		You never talk about Grandpa, and now you're getting rid of all his stuff!	
	{@dad}   Well, what is there to talk about? 
		The lost shipwreck of the Emerald has been haunting me my whole life.
		I need to find it. 
	{@you}   But Dad—
	{@dad}   I better finish setting things up. Wish me luck!

	{@you}  Wow. It's beautiful!
		I can't believe Dad just gave it to you. 
	{@reya} I know! Awesome, right?  
		That reminds me. I need your dive gear. 
	{@you}	What?? No! 
	{@reya}	Aw, come on. We're sisters. The rules don't count.
		I got hired to check out a shipwreck, and it's way down at 300 feet.
		I need your fancy deep-diving thing.
	{@you}	It's called a rebreather, and you're not trained to use it, Reya.
		You need an expert to help you. 
	{@reya} Awww, Jules! Thank you. I would love your help. 
	{@you}  Wait, that's not what I meant—
	{@reya}	It's near Port Washington.

	{@reya}  Yep. I think he likes you!
		Don't worry, I told him you were too busy with paperwork.

		{img postcard}
		It was left over from Dad's yard sale. Think it's worth anything? 
	{@you}   Hold on. Did you read this, Reya??
		Grandpa wrote that O.K. Steel sent him on an extra trip.
	{@reya}  Um... so? 
	{@you}   There's no official record of this. It doesn't match Dad's map. 
	{@dad}   Wait a sec. You mean... I've been searching the wrong part of the lake?? 
		{/img}
	{@reya}  Yes!!! I found a clue!!!
	{@you}   We have Grandpa's final route. Now we need to narrow down the location.
	{@reya}  Well, what are you waiting for, sis? Go do some research!!

	{@you}	Thanks, Amy!
		I'll send the steel sample to my mom. 
		She's a materials scientist. She can test it in her lab and find out more about it.

	{@you}   Hold on. I saw you last week! You're Cami's diving student, right?
	{@johnny} Yep. Gramps here was a sailor on the Emerald.
		I've been hearing his amazing stories my whole life. 
	{@you}   How do you know my sister?
	{@johnny} We took a skydiving class together.
		 I had no idea she was related to the captain of the Emerald!
	{@you}  Yeah. My family never talks about it. 
		I'm trying to find out what really happened.
	{@ed}   I wrote it all down in my journal.
		{img survivor-journal}
		We were sailing smoothly when all of a sudden, there was a loud BANG.
		The ship had started to break in half!
		The captain helped launch a lifeboat. Then he tried to radio for help, but the power went out as the ship broke apart.
		{/img}
	{@you}	Did you tell anyone what happened?
	{@ed}   I tried, but O.K. Steel put the blame on your grandpa. 
		People said I must've remembered it wrong. 
	{@you}	Did my grandpa ever talk about treasure?
	{@ed}	Hmm. Treasure?
		Oh, you must mean his locket! It had photos of his wife and son.
	{@you}	Thank you, Ed. I'm sorry it took so long for someone to listen to you. 
	{@ed}   I always hoped the truth would come out. I'm glad you didn't give up the search.

	{@you}   I still need to solve the mystery of why the ship sank.
	{@mom}   Actually... it's not such a mystery. 
		I tested the steel sample you sent me.
		It was weak and brittle. There's no way that ship could've held up against the waves.
	{@you}   Wow. So that's why the Emerald broke apart!
	{@mom}   Yep. It was only a matter of time.
	{@you}   I need to tell Dad. He was right all along.

	{@reya}  Hey sis. I heard you called Johnny! 
	{@you}   It was about the shipwreck.
	{@reya}  Ha. Sure it was. 
	{@dad}   Well?? What did you find out? 
	{@you}   We found it, Dad. The shipwreck is the Emerald. 
	{@reya}  YESS!!!!
	{@dad}   I can't believe it. After all this time.
	{@you}   You were right, Dad. The wreck wasn't Grandpa's fault. 
		The waves were rough, but the ship was sailing smoothly.
		Then there was a loud bang, and the Emerald broke in half!
	         Grandpa helped launch a life raft, but he wasn't able to make it to safety.  
	{@reya}   Whoa. Poor Grandpa.
	{@dad}   I don't understand. How can a huge freighter just break apart?
	{@you}   Mom found out that the ship was made of weak steel.
		It wasn't strong enough to hold up against the waves. 
	{@dad}   That's awful. I need to get the word out!
		What if there are other ships in danger?
	{@reya}  Okay, okay, that's great and all. But what about the treasure??
	{@you}   The treasure was Grandpa's locket. It had a picture of you, Dad.
	{@reya}   What? That's it?? 
		 Well, at least you can get a permit and go grab it. I know you're jealous of mine.
	{@you}   Actually, I think I'll donate the locket to the museum, in Grandpa's memory.
		 Sounds like he was an amazing captain.
	{@dad}   Um, about that... 
		 He was actually pretty reckless. 
	{@you}   What?!
	{@dad}    Oh, yeah. A real daredevil. 
	{@you}  Reya, he sounds a little like you.
	{@reya}  I can't wait to hear more stories!
	{@dad}   Ooh, here's a good one! 
		Did I ever tell you about the time he had to climb up on the pilot house in the middle of an ice storm? 
		It was November of 1959, and a cold wind was blowing...
