	{@you}  Dad, don't you think you're rushing into this? 
		We might never find the Emerald. 
		You don't even know how to use a sonar!
	{@dad}  Aw, don't worry, Jules. Reya says it's super easy. 
		I'll post the flyers myself. Wish me luck!

		I can't believe Dad just gave it to you. 
	{@reya} I know! Awesome, right?  
		That reminds me. I need your dive gear. 
	{@you}	What?? No!
	{@reya}	Aw, come on. We're sisters. The rules don't count.
		I got hired to check out a shipwreck, and it's way down at 300 feet.
		I need your fancy deep-diving thing.
	{@you}	It's called a rebreather, and you're not trained to use it, Reya.
		You need an expert to help you. 
	{@reya} Awww, Jules! Thank you. I would love your help. 
	{@you}  Wait, that's not what I meant--
	{@reya}	It's near Port Washington.

		I'm going through the leftover yard sale stuff. 
		It's mostly old letters and paperwork, but check out this awesome postcard!
		[Sends postcard]
		Think it's worth anything? 
	{@you}   Whoa, wait a sec. Reya, did you read this??
		The steel company sent Grandpa on an extra, unplanned trip.
	{@reya}  Um.... so? 
	{@you}   Dad doesn't know about this. He's been searching the wrong part of the lake!
	{@reya}  Ooh! I found... a clue??
		In this boring old stuff? 
	{@you}   It's not boring, Reya. It's our history!  
	{@reya}  Ha. Of course you would say that.
		Let's get out there!!
	{@you}  I still need to narrow down the location.
		I'll let you know what I find.

	{@amy}  You did?? I didn't know you were looking into it. 
	{@you}  Well.... my sister might've helped. A little. 
		[SEND MAP with new route added] 
		I marked my grandpa's route in blue.  
		He mentioned rough waves near the Apostle Islands. 
		Do you have any leads on shipwrecks in that area? 
	{@amy}	Hmm, let’s see... 
		[Send image: piece of steel with OK Steel logo] A fisherman pulled up this broken piece of steel a few years ago. 
		It could be from a freighter like your grandpa's.
		Location: 47°05'19.4"N 90°17'17.5"W
	{@you}	Thanks, Amy!
		I'll send the steel sample to my mom. 
		She can test it in her lab and learn more about it. 
	{@amy}	Good plan. Let me know what you find out!

	{@johnny}  You're Cami's friend, right? Didn't know you were a diver, too.
	{@you}  Oh, yeah, I love diving! I could take you out sometime!
		Um.... out on the lake, I mean.
	{@ed}   So how can we help you, Jules? 
	{@you}   Captain Griffin was my grandpa. I'm trying to find out what really happened.
	{@ed}   I was on that ship. I'll tell you what I know.
		The steel company sent us out on an unplanned run. At first, things were going fine.
		I was below decks when I heard a loud BANG.
	{@you}  What happened?
	{@ed}   I don't know. The ship just broke apart. Her old hull must've finally given out.
		Your grandpa sounded the alarm and got a life raft ready.
		Then a wave knocked a bunch of us overboard. Lucky we had that raft to hold onto. 
	{@johnny} Wow, Pops. Sounds like Captain Griffin saved your life. 
	{@ed}   I tried to tell my story, but then O.K. Steel put out their report.
		People said I must've remembered it wrong. 
	{@you}	Did my grandpa ever talk about treasure?
	{@ed}	Hmmm. Treasure?
		Oh, you must mean his locket! It had pictures of his wife and kid. 
		He kept it in a chest while he was on deck, so he wouldn't lose it.
	{@you}	Thank you, Ed. I'm sorry it took so long for someone to listen to you. 
	{@ed}   I'm just glad you didn't give up the search.
	{@you}  Um... actually, it was my dad who didn't give up.
	{@ed}  Well, tell him thank you from me.

		It was weak, brittle steel. 
		Definitely not strong enough to hold up against the waves. 
	{@you}  Wow. So that's why the Emerald broke apart!
	{@mom} Looks like it.
	{@you} I can't believe it. Dad was right.

	{@you}	Reya, we solved it!
		The wreck wasn't Grandpa's fault!
	{@reya}  Whoa. Seriously? I thought Grandpa was this wild, daredevil type guy.
		So what really happened? 
	{@you}	The Emerald was sailing past the Apostle Islands on her last run of the season.
		At first things seemed to be going fine.
		Then there was a loud bang, and the ship suddenly broke in half! 
	{@reya}  No way. How could a huge freighter just break apart?
	{@you}   Mom found out that weak steel was used in its construction.
		Grandpa helped launch a life raft. It helped save a bunch of the crew.
	{@reya}  Huh. That's nice, I guess.
		What about the treasure? Grandpa's letter was the whole reason I did this!
	{@you}	The treasure was Grandpa’s locket.
	{@reya}  What?! That's it? 
		Well, at least you can get a permit and go grab it. I know you're jealous of mine.
	{@you}   Actually.. I think I'll let the locket stay with the Emerald.
	{@reya}  Ugh. Still the same old boring sister. 
		Oh, that reminds me. My friend Johnny said he met you.
	{@you}   Wait! You know Johnny, too?
	{@reya}  He wants your number, but I told him you're too busy with paperwork.
