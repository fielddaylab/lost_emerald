	{@reya} Hey sis! Can I borrow some of your dive gear?
	{@you}	What?? No!
	{@reya}	Come on. Pretty please? I picked up a side job, and the wreck is down at 300 feet. I need your rebreather!
	{@you}	You’re not trained to dive that deep. You need an expert to help you.
	{@reya} Awww, Jules!! Thank you for offering. I would love your help!
