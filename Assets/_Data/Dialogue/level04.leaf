		We might never find the Emerald. 
		You don't even know how to use a sonar!
	{@dad}  Aw, don't worry, Jules. Reya says it's super easy.

		That reminds me. I need your dive gear. 
	{@you}	What?? No!
	{@reya}	Aw, come on. We're sisters. The rules don't count.
		I got hired to check out a shipwreck, and it's way down at 300 feet.
		I need your fancy deep-diving thing.
	{@you}	It's called a rebreather, and you're not trained to use it, Reya.
		You need an expert to help you. 
	{@reya} Awww, Jules! Thank you. I would love your help. 
	{@you}  Wait, that's not what I meant--
	{@reya}	It's near Port Washington.

		It's mostly old letters and paperwork, but check out this awesome postcard!
		{img postcard}
		Think it's worth anything? 
	{@you}   Whoa, wait a sec. Reya, did you read this??
		The steel company sent Grandpa on an extra, unplanned trip.
	{@reya}  Um.... so? 
	{@you}   Dad doesn't know about this. He's been searching the wrong part of the lake!
	{@reya}  Ooh! I found... a clue??
		In this boring old stuff? 
	{@you}   It's not boring, Reya. It's our history!  
	{@reya}  Ha. Of course you would say that.

	{@you}  Well.... my sister might've helped. A little. 
		[SEND MAP with new route added] 
		I marked my grandpa's route in blue.  
		He mentioned rough waves near the Apostle Islands. 
		Do you have any leads on shipwrecks in that area? 
	{@amy}	Hmm, let’s see... 
		[Send image: piece of steel with OK Steel logo]
		A fisherman pulled up this broken piece of steel a few years ago. 
		It could be from a freighter like your grandpa's.
		Location: 47°05'19.4"N 90°17'17.5"W
	{@you}	Thanks, Amy!
		I'll send the steel sample to my mom. 
		She can test it in her lab and learn more about it. 
	{@amy}	Good plan. Let me know what you find out!

	{@johnny} You're Cami's friend, right? Didn't realize you were a diver, too. 
	{@you}   Oh, uh, yeah! I love it. Diving. Maybe we should go out sometime. 
		Um... out on the lake, I mean.
	{@ed}    So, you're related to Captain Griffin?
	{@you}   He was my grandpa. I'm trying to figure out what really happened.
	{@ed}   I was on that ship. I'll tell you what I know.
		The steel company sent us out on an unplanned run. 
		The waves were rough, but nothing we hadn't seen before. 
		I was below decks when I heard a loud BANG.
	{@you}  What happened?
	{@ed}   The ship just broke apart. Her old hull must've finally given out.
		Your grandpa did the best he could. He sounded the alarm and got a life raft ready.
		Then a wave knocked a bunch of us overboard. Lucky we had that raft to hold onto. 
	{@johnny} Wow, Pops. Sounds like Captain Griffin saved your life. 
	{@you}	Did you tell anyone what happened?
	{@ed}   I tried, but then O.K. Steel put out their report.
		People said I must've remembered it wrong. 
	{@you}	Did my grandpa ever talk about treasure?
	{@ed}	Huh. Treasure?
		You must mean his locket! It had photos of his wife and kid.
		He kept it in a chest while he was on deck, so he wouldn't lose it.
	{@you}	Thank you, Ed. I'm sorry it took so long for someone to listen to you. 
	{@ed}   I always hoped the truth would come out. Good thing you didn't give up the search.
	{@you}   Uh, actually, my dad was the one who wouldn't give up.
	{@ed}   Well, tell him thank you from me.

	{@mom}	Hey Jules. 
		Your dad told me you found the Emerald!
		Nice work out there. 
	{@you}	Thanks, Mom. What did you find out?
	{@mom}	That sample you sent me?
		It was brittle, notch-sensitive steel, made in the 1930s.
	{@you}	Brittle? Notch-sensitive? What does that mean?
	{@mom}  Basically, the steel was weak.
		Definitely not strong enough to hold up against the waves. 
	{@you}   Wow. So that's why the Emerald broke apart!
	{@mom}  This is a big deal, Jules.  
		Any ship made with this steel is still at risk.
	{@you}   Oh no. We need to get the word out!
	{@mom}   Your dad's already on it. 
		[Newspaper article: "Captain Griffin redeemed! The wreck of the Emerald was caused by brittle steel used in her construction. Now shipwreck hunter Daniel Griffin is on a mission to warn ship owners..."
	{@you}   Wow. That's amazing!
	{@mom}   Maybe this will be enough to get some new policies in place and keep people safe. 
	{@you}   Yeah. I hope so.

	{@you}	Reya, we solved it!
		The wreck wasn't Grandpa's fault. Dad was right!
	{@reya}  Whoa. Seriously?? I thought Grandpa was this wild, daredevil type guy.
		So what really happened? 
	{@you}	The Emerald was sailing on rough seas, on her last run of the season.
		Then the ship suddenly broke in half!
		Grandpa helped launch a life raft, but he wasn't able to make it to safety. 
	{@reya}  No way. How could a huge freighter just break apart?
	{@you}   Mom found out that brittle steel was used in its construction.
		Dad is on a mission to warn ship owners and make sure it never happens again. 
	{@reya}  Huh. That's nice for him, I guess.
		What about the treasure? Grandpa's letter was the whole reason I did this!
	{@you}	The treasure was Grandpa’s locket.
	{@reya}  What??? That's it? 
		Well, at least you can get a permit and go grab it. I know you're jealous of mine.
	{@you}   You know...I think I'll let the locket stay with the Emerald. 
	{@reya}  Ugh. Boring, but whatever.
		 Oh, by the way, my friend Johnny said he met you.
	{@you}   What?? You know him?
	{@reya}  He wants your number, but I told him you're too busy with paperwork.
