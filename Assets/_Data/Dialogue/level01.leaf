	{@lou} 	Jules!! I was out flying by Rawley Point today and saw this: 
		   	(image of ship outline from above)
	 		GPS coordinates: N 44Â° 11.524' W 087Â° 30.591'
	 		What do you think?
	{@you} 	Looks like a shipwreck!
	{@lou}	Yes!!! 
	{@you}	The storm last night mustâ€™ve uncovered it.
			Thanks, Lou!
	{@lou} 	No prob! ðŸ˜Ž
