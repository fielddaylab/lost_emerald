	{@dad}	Hey, Jules! I've got a new shipwreck for you to check out!
		{img broken-wheel}
		My buddy pulled this up in his nets on Lake Michigan.
	{@you}	Looks like a broken piece of a paddlewheel! Must be from a sidewheel steamer.
		I'll talk to my colleague, Cami. She's an expert on those ships. 
		Did you get the latitude and longitude? 
	{@dad}	Yep! It's near Sheboygan.
		Location: 43°42'08.6"N 87°38'26.0"W
		{/img}
	{@you}	Thanks, Dad. How's the new sonar?
	{@dad}   Uh... great! I think. 
		I'm out on Lake Superior right now. Check out my map!
		{img dad-map}
		Your grandpa’s last scheduled route is marked in red.
	{@you}   That's a huge area. It could take years to search.
		{/img}
	{@dad}   I know! Wanna come out and help me?
		Jules?
	{@you} 	Dad, I saw the investigation report.
		Why didn't you tell me the shipwreck was Grandpa's fault?
	{@dad}  Of course it wasn't his fault, Jules! They just blamed him.
		That's why I need to find the Emerald--to clear your Grandpa's name!
	{@you}  Dad, what if it WAS his fault? From your stories, it sounds like Grandpa could be pretty reckless--
	{@dad}  Oh, look at that! Sonar's finally working! Gotta go, Jules. Wish me luck!

	{@cami}  Hey Jules! You need some info on a sidewheel steamer? 
	{@you}   Yep! Thanks for calling, Cami. 
		Ooh, who's that cute guy with you? 
	{@cami}  This is Johnny, my diving student. Who can currently hear everything you're saying.
	{@you}   Oh!! Um, hi, Johnny! I'm Jules. But I guess Cami already said that, so...yeah. 
	{@johnny}  Hey.
	{@cami}  I heard you found a sidewheel steamer out near Sheboygan. 
		Could be the Paradise! I've been looking for that ship for ages. 
			{img ps_paradise_ad_sketch}
		The Paradise was super fancy, but tickets were pretty cheap.
		She was carrying a mix of rich passengers, immigrant workers, and other folks traveling west. 
		The manifest got lost, so nobody knows what cargo she was carrying. 
			{/img}
	{@you}	Wow. You know all about this ship!
	{@cami}	It's sort of a pet project of mine. 
		Look for the famous red anchor. It should have the name engraved. 
	{@you}  Thanks, Cami!

	{@you}	Hey Cami, great news. The ship is the Paradise!
	{@cami}  Wahoo! Nice work, Jules.
		I'll send you the survivor accounts of the sinking. 
	{@you}	Thanks!  
		So... why's this ship so important to you? 
	{@cami}  When I was a kid, my best friend had ancestors on the Paradise.
		It's the reason I decided to become a maritime archaeologist. 
	{@you}   Wow. That's amazing.
	{@cami}  Yeah. It'll mean a lot to tell her we finally found the ship. 
		 Thanks to you and your dad!
	{@you}    Oh! Uh... yeah, happy to help!

	{@you}   Hey, Dad. Um... sorry I was so hard on you early. 
		Any luck finding Grandpa's ship?
	{@dad}	Nah. Sonar’s on the fritz again.
		Wanna fill me in on that sidewheel steamer?
	{@you}	Sure! The ship is a Palace Steamer, the Paradise.
	{@you}	She was sailing past Sheboygan when a fire started in the boiler room.
	{@dad}	Yikes. Fire on a wooden ship--not a good combination. 
	{@you}	Nope. The fire spread super fast. 
		There weren't enough lifeboats for everyone, and people panicked. 
		One guy even jumped into a lifeboat with a bunch of gold bars and broke the ropes!
		A nearby ship saw the fire and came to help, but they couldn't save everyone. 
	{@dad}	Oh boy, what a tragedy.
	{@you}	Yeah. It must've been pretty scary...
