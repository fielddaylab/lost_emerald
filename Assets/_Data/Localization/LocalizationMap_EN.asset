  - '{@dad} That''s great!'
  - The Emerald has been lost for so long.
  - If I could just find it, it would fix everything!
  - '{@you} Wait... fix what? What do you mean?'
  - '{@dad} Sorry, Jules, no time to talk. I''ve got work to do!'
  - '{@lou} Hiya, Jules!'
  - "{@you} Hey Lou. What\u2019s all that noise?"
  - "{@lou} Oh, I\u2019m just out flying over Lake Michigan on my ultralight plane."
  - "{@you} What??? You\u2019re flying right now? Isn't that dangerous?"
  - '{@lou} Not as dangerous as sitting at home, bored out of my mind.'
  - Check out what I found!
  - What do you think?
  - '{@you} Looks like a shipwreck!'
  - '{@lou} Awesome! I thought it might be.'
  - It's in Lake Michigan, near Rawley Point.
  - I'll send you the latitude and longitude.
  - "Location: N 44\xB0 11.524' W 087\xB0 30.591'"
  - '{@you} Thanks, Lou. Stay safe out there!'
  - '{@you}The ship should be around here somewhere. Time to drive my boat around
    and find it with my sonar.'
  - "{@you}There it is! I\u2019ll drop a buoy to mark the location."
  - '{@you}Looks like some of the rigging that held up the mast is still here!'
  - '{@you} There''s the ship!'
  - I'll take a photo from up here.
  - '{@you} Got it!'
  - Time to dive down and take more pictures.
  - '{@you} Yes! The ship''s name!'
  - Looks like some letters are missing.
  - '{@you} Whoa! What a cool old artifact.'
  - Looks like a knife. I wonder whose it was.
  - '{@you} I already got a photo of this.'
  - '{@you} Better zoom in so I can see this better.'
  - '{@you} I should zoom out so I can fit more in the picture.'
  - '{@you} I don''t need a photo of this.'
  - '{@you} Hey, Amy! How are things at the archives?'
  - '{@amy} Great! Just digging up some documents for a new exhibit.'
  - Lou clued me in on the dive. How was it?
  - '{@you} Beautiful! The ship was in great condition. No mussels or plant life.'
  - '{@amy} Hmmm. It must''ve been covered up in sand until now.'
  - '{@you} The shipwreck was near Rawley Point.'
  - Can you send me a list of ships that sank in that area?
  - '{@amy} Sure. Here you go!'
  - '{@you} Thanks, Amy!'
  - '{@amy} So? What''d you find out?'
  - '{@you} Our ship is the Loretta!'
  - '{@amy} Wow! What an amazing find.'
  - Looks like it sank on the same day that the town of Peshtigo burned down.
  - '{@you}  Yikes. A whole town burned down?'
  - '{@amy}  Well, not the WHOLE town, but a lot of it.'
  - It was the worst fire in American history.
  - All the smoke blew over the lake and made it hard for the captain to see.
  - 'Here''s a portrait of him:'
  - '{@you} Hey, that''s the knife I saw!'
  - '{@amy} It must''ve gone down with the ship.'
  - '{@you} Wow, look at that sailor''s knife!'
  - '{@amy} It was the captain''s. Sounds like it went down with the ship.'
  - '{@you} Hmm. I should dive again. Maybe it''s still down there.'
  - '{@amy} I''ve got an article about how it sank. I''ll send it over!'
  - '{@lou} Hey, Jules!'
  - I'm out flying again. Weather's great today!
  - Any juicy details on that shipwreck?
  - '{@you} Yes! The ship is the Loretta!'
  - '{@lou} Awesome name. How''d it sink?'
  - '{@you} Wildfires were burning all across Wisconsin, including an awful fire
    in Peshtigo, Wisconsin.'
  - The wind blew a ton of smoke out over the lake.
  - '{@lou}  How could the captain see where he was going?'
  - '{@you}  He couldn''t. The Loretta sailed too close to shore and got stuck on
    a sandbar!'
  - The sailors had to climb up into the rigging. Luckily, they were rescued by a
    fishing boat.
  - '{@lou} Wow! What a wild story.'
  - Can you imagine what it was like that night?
  - '{@you}  Yeah...'
  - '{@dad} Hey, kiddo! I need a favor.'
  - Can you put up these flyers at your work?
  - '{@you} Wait a minute. You''re having a yard sale?'
  - '{@dad} Yep! Didn''t I tell ya?'
  - I need money to buy a sonar for my boat.
  - '{@you} Dad, you don''t even know how sonar works!'
  - And what about our family history??
  - You never talk about Grandpa, and now you're getting rid of all his stuff!
  - '{@dad}  Well, what is there to talk about?'
  - The lost shipwreck of the Emerald has been haunting me my whole life.
  - I need to find it.
  - "{@you}  But Dad\u2014"
  - '{@dad}  I better finish setting things up. Wish me luck!'
  - '{@reya} Hey, sis!'
  - Check out my new necklace. It was Grandma's!
  - It has her old wedding photo inside.
  - '{@you} Wow. It''s beautiful!'
  - I can't believe Dad just gave it to you.
  - '{@reya} I know! Awesome, right?'
  - That reminds me. I need your dive gear.
  - '{@you} What?? No! That''s against the rules!'
  - '{@reya} Aw, come on. We''re sisters. The rules don''t count.'
  - I got hired to check out a shipwreck, and it's way down at 300 feet.
  - I need your fancy deep-diving thing.
  - '{@you} It''s called a rebreather, and you''re not trained to use it, Reya.'
  - You need an expert to help you.
  - '{@reya} Awww, Jules! Thank you. I would love your help.'
  - "{@you} Wait, that's not what I meant\u2014"
  - '{@reya} It''s near Port Washington.'
  - "Location: 43\xB020'08.2\"N 87\xB034'11.3\"W"
  - Race ya there!
  - '{@reya} Hey sis! Ready to go treasure hunting?'
  - '{@you} I''m not a treasure hunter, Reya.'
  - My job is about history! Solving mysteries, uncovering lost stories...
  - '{@reya} Yaaaawn. Whatever floats your boat, I guess.'
  - "{@reya} Anyway, the ship\u2019s down there."
  - '{@reya} Break a leg! Or a flipper, or whatever.'
  - '{@you} Got it!'
  - Can you hear me through the coms, Reya? I'm diving down deeper.
  - '{@reya} Copy that, sis.'
  - '{@you} That''s the ship! Looks like it''s covered in mussels.'
  - I should grab a top-down photo.
  - '{@you} Looks like something crashed into the ship here.'
  - '{@you} Wow! There''s an old car in the cargo area!'
  - '{@reya} Huh? What''s cargo?'
  - '{@you}  Oh, "cargo" just means the items that the ship was carrying.'
  - '{@reya} Ha. The "cargo" is a car that won''t go! Get it??'
  - '{@you} There''s an old safe! I wonder what''s inside.'
  - '{@reya} A safe?! You gotta grab it!'
  - '{@you}  No way, Reya. It''s illegal to take anything without a permit.'
  - '{@reya} Ugh. You are SO BORING. I can''t believe we''re related.'
  - '{@you} I''ll have a better view of that from the other side.'
  - '{@you} There''s the cargo hatch!'
  - Hmm. Looks like part of an old car, but there's not much left.
  - '{@you} I already got a photo of this.'
  - '{@you} I should zoom in for a better shot!'
  - '{@you} Better zoom out a little.'
  - '{@you} I don''t need a photo of this.'
  - '{@amy} Hey! Heard you went on a dive with your sister.'
  - "How\u2019d it go?"
  - '{@you} Well... she called me boring and tried to get me in trouble.'
  - But we found an amazing wreck!
  - It's a freighter near Port Washington. It was carrying old cars.
  - '{@amy} Hmm. Looks like two freighters sank in that area with cars onboard.'
  - One with Kissel cars, and one with Nash cars.
  - They used to be made here in Wisconsin!
  - '{@you}  Hmm. So if I can identify the car I found, I should be able to figure
    out the ship!'
  - '{@amy}  I''ve got a friend at the auto museum. I''ll have him call you.'
  - '{@you} Thanks, Amy!'
  - "{@cooper} Hi there! Are you Amy\u2019s friend?"
  - '{@you} Yep. I''m Jules Griffin.'
  - Can you send me photos of Nash and Kissel brand cars?
  - '{@cooper} Of course! Just a minute...'
  - '{@you} Awesome, thanks!'
  - '{@cooper}   It''s funny. You''ve got the same last name as the captain who caused
    that awful shipwreck.'
  - '{@you} Um, yeah. I know.'
  - Wait... did you say the captain CAUSED the shipwreck?
  - '{@cooper} That''s right. It was a local legend when I was a kid.'
  - The steel company that owned the ship said it was in great condition. The strongest
    freighter on the lake!
  - But the captain took it out in a terrible storm.
  - If only he'd been more careful.
  - '{@you} Wow. I had no idea.'
  - Thanks again, Cooper.
  - '{@cooper} Happy to help!'
  - '{@amy} Any news on the shipwreck?'
  - '{@you} Yep, the ship is the Madison!'
  - '{@amy} Nice work, Jules!'
  - "I\u2019ll send you the transcript of the radio distress call."
  - And the ship manifest, too!
  - '{@you} Thanks, Amy!'
  - '{@reya} Hey, sis! Figure out that ship?'
  - '{@you} Actually, yes. The ship is the Madison!'
  - '{@reya} Cool. I solved a mystery too.'
  - '{@you} What?! Reya, how did you get that safe?'
  - '{@reya} The guy who hired me got a permit to bring it up!'
  - It's just a bunch of nickels and an old alarm clock. I was hoping for gold.
  - But they're gonna display it at a museum, with my name on it!
  - What about the Madison? I wanna know how it sank!
  - '{@you} Fine. Let''s see...'
  - "It was a super foggy day\u2014the same day the stock market crashed and started
    the Great Depression."
  - The Madison was carrying 268 Wisconsin-made Nash cars to Detroit.
  - All of a sudden, another freighter appeared in the fog.
  - The ships were too close to avoid crashing. The SS Lookout rammed the Madison!
  - '{@reya} Ha. Biggest car wreck ever!'
  - '{@you} The captain of the Lookout panicked and headed to port, leaving the Madison
    behind.'
  - Luckily, another ship came to help, but a bunch of people didn't survive.
  - '{@reya} Wow. That''s actually a great story.'
  - Super sad, though.
  - I wonder if anybody saw it coming...
  - '{@dad} Hey, Jules. I''ve got a shipwreck for you to check out!'
  - My fishing buddy pulled this up on Lake Michigan.
  - '{@you} Looks like part of a sidewheel steamer!'
  - I'll talk to my mentor, Cami. She's an expert on those ships.
  - Did you get the latitude and longitude?
  - '{@dad} Yep. It''s near Sheboygan.'
  - "Location: 43\xB042'08.6\"N 87\xB038'26.0\"W"
  - '{@you} Thanks, Dad.'
  - How's the new sonar?
  - '{@dad}  Uh... not so great.'
  - But I'm sure I'll figure it out. Eventually.
  - I'm out on Lake Superior right now. Got my map with me.
  - "Your grandpa\u2019s last planned route is marked in red."
  - The Emerald must be around here somewhere.
  - '{@you} Dad... why didn''t you tell me the shipwreck was Grandpa''s fault?'
  - '{@dad} What?! Of course it wasn''t his fault.'
  - '{@you} The steel company said it was.'
  - '{@dad} They just needed somebody to blame. How can you think that about your
    own grandpa?!'
  - '{@you} Well, you never talk about him! What was he like?'
  - '{@dad} Never mind that, Jules.'
  - We just need to find that ship. Then you'll see.
  - '{@cami} Hey Jules! You need some info on a sidewheel steamer?'
  - '{@you}  Yep! Thanks for calling, Cami.'
  - Who's that guy with you?
  - '{@cami} Johnny''s my new diving student.'
  - He's full of awesome stories. You should chat with him sometime!
  - '{@you}  Maybe later.'
  - Have you heard of any sidewheel steamers that wrecked near Sheboygan?
  - '{@cami} Ooh, could be the Paradise!'
  - Here, check it out!
  - Gorgeous, huh? It sank in 1856.
  - People called these type of ships Palace Steamers, because they were so fancy.
  - The manifest was lost, so the cargo is unknown.
  - '{@you} Wow, you know a ton about this ship!'
  - '{@cami} Yep! It''s a favorite project of mine.'
  - Keep a lookout for the red anchor. It should have the name engraved on it.
  - '{@you} Thanks, Cami!'
  - '{@you} The ship should be down there somewhere. Time to use my sonar!'
  - '{@you} Got it!'
  - '{@you} Yes! It''s the Paradise!'
  - Can't wait to tell Cami.
  - '{@you} Whoa. Are those... gold bars??'
  - Where on earth did those come from?
  - '{@you} Got the cargo!'
  - Wow... these rocking horses are more than 100 years old!
  - '{@you} What''s that written on the anchor?'
  - '{@you} That paddle wheel matches the one in Dad''s photo!'
  - '{@you} Whoa. What happened here? The ship is totally destroyed!'
  - Looks like the engine is missing. The ship owners must've had someone bring it
    up from the wreck.
  - '{@you} I should try a different angle for a better shot'
  - '{@you} I already got a photo of this.'
  - '{@you} I should zoom in for a better shot!'
  - '{@you} Better zoom out to get more in the picture.'
  - '{@you} I don''t need a photo of this.'
  - '{@you} Hey Cami, great news. The ship is the Paradise!'
  - '{@cami} Wahoo! Nice work, Jules.'
  - I'll send you the survivor accounts of the sinking.
  - '{@you} Thanks!'
  - '{@you} So, why''s this ship so important to you?'
  - '{@cami} When I was little, my best friend had ancestors who were lost on the
    Paradise.'
  - It's the reason I became a maritime archaeologist.
  - It'll mean a lot to tell her we finally found it.
  - '{@you} Wow, that''s amazing!'
  - Glad I could help.
  - '{@you} Hey, Dad! Any luck finding Grandpa''s ship?'
  - "{@dad} Nah. Sonar\u2019s on the fritz again."
  - You were right, Jules. I'm not cut out for this.
  - '{@you} Aw, Dad. Don''t give up.'
  - Thanks to you, we found a piece of history that was lost for more than 100 years!
  - '{@dad} Ooh. That sidewheel steamer? What''d you find out?'
  - '{@you} The ship is a Palace Steamer, the Paradise!'
  - '{@you} It was traveling past Sheboygan when a fire started in the boiler room.'
  - "{@dad} Yikes. Fire on a wooden ship\u2014that's not good."
  - '{@you} Nope. The fire spread super fast, and people panicked.'
  - One guy even jumped into a lifeboat with a bunch of heavy gold bars and broke
    the ropes!
  - Another ship saw the fire and came to help, but they couldn't save everyone.
  - '{@dad} Oh boy, what a tragedy.'
  - '{@you} Yeah. It must''ve been pretty scary...'
  - '{@reya} Hey sis!'
  - I heard you met my friend Johnny. He asked for your number!
  - '{@you}  Johnny... that''s Cami''s diving student, right?'
  - '{@reya} Yep. I think he likes you!'
  - Don't worry, I told him you were too busy with paperwork.
  - Ooh, that reminds me... check out this awesome postcard!
  - It was left over from Dad's yard sale. Think it's worth anything?
  - '{@you}  Hold on. Did you read this, Reya??'
  - Grandpa wrote that O.K. Steel sent him on an extra trip.
  - '{@reya} Um... so?'
  - '{@you}  There''s no official record of this. It doesn''t match Dad''s map.'
  - '{@dad}  Wait a sec. You mean... I''ve been searching the wrong part of the lake??'
  - '{@reya} Yes!!! I found a clue!!!'
  - '{@you}  We have Grandpa''s final route. Now we need to narrow down the location.'
  - '{@reya} Well, what are you waiting for, sis? Go do some research!!'
  - "{@you} Amy, I need your help. I found a new lead on Grandpa\u2019s ship!"
  - '{@amy} You did??'
  - '{@you} Well... my sister helped. A little.'
  - I marked my grandpa's route in blue.
  - He mentioned rough waves near the Apostle Islands.
  - Do you have any evidence of shipwrecks in that area?
  - "{@amy} Hmm, let\u2019s see..."
  - A fisherman pulled up this broken piece of steel near Outer Island.
  - It could be from a freighter like your grandpa's.
  - "Location: 47\xB005'19.4\"N 90\xB017'17.5\"W"
  - '{@you} Thanks, Amy!'
  - I'll send the steel sample to my mom.
  - She's a materials scientist. She can test it in her lab and find out more about
    it.
  - '{@reya} Well????'
  - "{@you} I\u2019ve got a location of a steel shipwreck. It could be Grandpa's."
  - '{@reya} Yes!!! Treasure, here we come!'
  - '{@you} Reya, slow down.'
  - What if it's not the Emerald?
  - '{@reya} Aww, sis. You worry too much.'
  - Get out there and check it out!
  - Dad and I will be waiting by the phone!
  - "{@you} Well... that\u2019s definitely a ship."
  - I wonder if it's Grandpa's.
  - '{@you} Whoa. Is it me or is that ship... broken in half?'
  - '{@you} Got it!'
  - '{@you} Wow. I can''t believe it. We found the Emerald!'
  - "I can\u2019t wait to tell Dad!"
  - '{@you} That locket looks just like Reya''s!'
  - I wonder if it was Grandpa's.
  - '{@you} I should get a photo of the ship split in half.'
  - '{@you} There''s the crane they used for loading the cargo!'
  - '{@you} Wow, the pilot house. That would''ve been where Grandpa worked!'
  - '{@you} Looks like the ship was carrying iron ore.'
  - '{@you} Maybe I can get a better angle. I need to show both sides of the break
    in the ship.'
  - '{@you} The other side might have a better angle to show both parts of the ship.'
  - '{@you} I already got a photo of this.'
  - '{@you} I should zoom in for a better shot!'
  - '{@you} Better zoom out a little.'
  - '{@you} I don''t need a photo of this.'
  - "{@amy} Hey, Jules! How\u2019d it go?"
  - '{@you} I found the Emerald!'
  - Now I need to figure out how it sank.
  - The legend says the ship was super strong.
  - I wonder how it broke in half.
  - '{@amy} I think I can help.'
  - Cami managed to track down a survivor from the Emerald!
  - She sent me his contact info.
  - 'Edmund Brooks: 555-1242'
  - '{@you} Wow, that''s so lucky! Thanks, Amy!'
  - '{@you} Hi. Are you Mr. Brooks?'
  - '{@ed} Call me Ed. This is my grandson, Johnny.'
  - '{@you}  Hold on. I saw you last week! You''re Cami''s diving student, right?'
  - '{@johnny} Yep. Gramps here was a sailor on the Emerald.'
  - I've been hearing his amazing stories my whole life.
  - '{@you}  How do you know my sister?'
  - '{@johnny} We took a skydiving class together.'
  - I had no idea she was related to the captain of the Emerald!
  - '{@you} Yeah. My family never talks about it.'
  - I'm trying to find out what really happened.
  - '{@ed}  I wrote it all down in my journal.'
  - We were sailing smoothly when all of a sudden, there was a loud BANG.
  - The ship had started to break in half!
  - The captain helped launch a lifeboat. Then he tried to radio for help, but the
    power went out as the ship broke apart.
  - '{@you} Did you tell anyone what happened?'
  - '{@ed}  I tried, but O.K. Steel put the blame on your grandpa.'
  - People said I must've remembered it wrong.
  - '{@you} Did my grandpa ever talk about treasure?'
  - '{@ed} Hmm. Treasure?'
  - Oh, you must mean his locket! It had photos of his wife and son.
  - '{@you} Thank you, Ed. I''m sorry it took so long for someone to listen to you.'
  - '{@ed}  I always hoped the truth would come out. I''m glad you didn''t give up
    the search.'
  - '{@you} Actually, it was my dad who wouldn''t give up.'
  - '{@ed}  Well, tell him thank you from me.'
  - '{@mom} Hey Sweetie! How''d it go out there?'
  - '{@you}  I found the Emerald!'
  - '{@mom}  That''s wonderful, Jules!'
  - '{@you}  I still need to solve the mystery of why the ship sank.'
  - '{@mom}  Actually... it''s not such a mystery.'
  - I tested the steel sample you sent me.
  - It was weak and brittle. There's no way that ship could've held up against the
    waves.
  - '{@you}  Wow. So that''s why the Emerald broke apart!'
  - '{@mom}  Yep. It was only a matter of time.'
  - '{@you}  I need to tell Dad. He was right all along.'
  - Thanks for your help, Mom!
  - '{@mom}  No problem, Sweetie.'
  - I'm heading home soon, but I'll let you tell him.
  - Nice work out there.
  - '{@reya} Hey sis. I heard you called Johnny!'
  - '{@you}  It was about the shipwreck.'
  - '{@reya} Ha. Sure it was.'
  - '{@dad}  Well?? What did you find out?'
  - '{@you}  We found it, Dad. The shipwreck is the Emerald.'
  - '{@reya} YESS!!!!'
  - '{@dad}  I can''t believe it. After all this time.'
  - '{@you}  You were right, Dad. The wreck wasn''t Grandpa''s fault.'
  - The waves were rough, but the ship was sailing smoothly.
  - Then there was a loud bang, and the Emerald broke in half!
  - Grandpa helped launch a life raft, but he wasn't able to make it to safety.
  - '{@reya}  Whoa. Poor Grandpa.'
  - '{@dad}  I don''t understand. How can a huge freighter just break apart?'
  - '{@you}  Mom found out that the ship was made of weak steel.'
  - It wasn't strong enough to hold up against the waves.
  - '{@dad}  That''s awful. I need to get the word out!'
  - What if there are other ships in danger?
  - '{@reya} Okay, okay, that''s great and all. But what about the treasure??'
  - '{@you}  The treasure was Grandpa''s locket. It had a picture of you, Dad.'
  - '{@reya}  What? That''s it??'
  - Well, at least you can get a permit and go grab it. I know you're jealous of
    mine.
  - '{@you}  Actually, I think I''ll donate the locket to the museum, in Grandpa''s
    memory.'
  - Sounds like he was an amazing captain.
  - '{@dad}  Um, about that...'
  - He was actually pretty reckless.
  - '{@you}  What?!'
  - '{@dad}  Oh, yeah. A real daredevil.'
  - '{@you} Reya, he sounds a little like you.'
  - '{@reya} I can''t wait to hear more stories!'
  - '{@dad}  Ooh, here''s a good one!'
  - Did I ever tell you about the time he had to climb up on the pilot house in the
    middle of an ice storm?
  - It was November of 1959, and a cold wind was blowing...
