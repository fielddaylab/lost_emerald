@8044AFC1,{@dad}  Hey Jules! Big news!,,Begin Dialogue
@7D44AB08,"You know how your grandpa's ship sank on Lake Superior, when I was just a kid?",,
@7E44AC9B,{@you}  Of course. You've been talking about that shipwreck since I was little.,,
@8344B47A,"{@dad}  Well, I found one of your grandpa's old letters.",,
@8144B154,"His ship, the SS Emerald, was carrying treasure!",,
@8244B2E7,"{@you}  Since when do you care about treasure, Dad?",,
@7844A329,"{@dad}  I don't, but your sister does!",,
@DD20F863,She's gonna help me find the shipwreck!,,
@DC20F6D0,She also found your grandma's locket. Looks nice on her.,,
@DF20FB89,{@you}  Wait. You let Reya take the locket??,,
@DE20F9F6,"{@dad}  Well, you weren't here.",,
@E120FEAF,So what do you say? Wanna help us?,,
@E020FD1C,{@you}  Well... I guess I can start a file for Grandpa's ship.,,
@E32101D5,{@dad}  That's great!,,
@E2210042,The Emerald has been lost for so long.,,
@E52104FB,"If I could just find it, it would fix everything!",,
@E4210368,{@you}  Wait... fix what? What do you mean?,,
@6B198928,"{@dad}  Sorry, Jules, no time to talk. I've got work to do!",,
@5418E3F7,"{@lou}  Hiya, Jules!",,
@5318E264,{@you} \tHey Lou. What’s all that noise?,,
@5218E0D1,"{@lou} \tOh, I’m just out flying over Lake Michigan on my ultralight plane.",,
@5118DF3E,{@you} \tWhat??? You’re flying right now? Isn't that dangerous?,,
@5018DDAB,"{@lou} \tNot as dangerous as sitting at home, bored out of my mind.",,
@4F18DC18,Check out what I found!,,
@4D18D8F2,What do you think?,,
@B031A3CE,{@you} \tLooks like a shipwreck!,,
@B131A561,{@lou} \tAwesome! I thought it might be.,,
@AE31A0A8,"It's in Lake Michigan, near Rawley Point.",,
@AF31A23B,I'll send you the latitude and longitude.,,
@B431AA1A,Location: N 44° 11.524' W 087° 30.591',,
@B231A6F4,"{@you} \tThanks, Lou. Stay safe out there!",,
@A4009702,{@you}\tThe ship should be around here somewhere. Time to drive my boat around and find it with my sonar.,,
@ADE2F165,{@you}\tThere it is! I’ll drop a buoy to mark the location.,,
@4962B5FE,{@you}\tLooks like some of the rigging that held up the mast is still here!,,
@CA5F1B66,{@you} There's the ship!,,
@CB5F1CF9,I'll take a photo from up here.,,
@BBBDDF4A,{@you} Got it!,,
@BCBDE0DD,Time to dive down and take more pictures.,,
@49402F6A,{@you} Yes! The ship's name!,,
@4A4030FD,Looks like some letters are missing.,,
@C83A0457,{@you} Whoa! What a cool old artifact.,,
@C73A02C4,Looks like a knife. I wonder whose it was.,,
@E70EF610,{@you}\tI already got a photo of this.,,
@0A4C275F,{@you}\tBetter zoom in so I can see this better.,,
@ED3C241C,{@you}\tI should zoom out so I can fit more in the picture.,,
@F9FF290C,{@you}\tI don't need a photo of this.,,
@A2011ED9,"{@you}  Hey, Amy! How are things at the archives?",,
@9F011A20,{@amy}  Great! Just digging up some documents for a new exhibit.,,
@A0011BB3,Lou clued me in on the dive. How was it?,,
@A5012392,{@you}  Beautiful! The ship was in great condition. No mussels or plant life.,,
@A6012525,{@amy}  Hmmm. It must've been covered up in sand until now.,,
@A301206C,{@you}  The shipwreck was near Rawley Point.,,
@A40121FF,Can you send me a list of ships that sank in that area?,,
@AA012B71,{@amy}   Sure. Here you go!,,
@EFC3A738,"{@you}   Thanks, Amy!",,
@476EF3F9,{@amy}  So? What'd you find out?,,
@466EF266,{@you} \tOur ship is the Loretta!,,
@456EF0D3,{@amy} \tWow! What an amazing find.,,
@446EEF40,Looks like it sank on the same day that the town of Peshtigo burned down.,,
@4B6EFA45,{@you}   Yikes. A whole town burned down?,,
@4A6EF8B2,"{@amy}   Well, not the WHOLE town, but a lot of it.",,
@496EF71F,It was the worst fire in American history.,,
@4F6F0091,All the smoke blew over the lake and made it hard for the captain to see.,,
@4E6EFEFE,Here's a portrait of him:,,
@34A77A3C,"{@you}  Hey, that's the knife I saw!",,
@35A77BCF,{@amy}  It must've gone down with the ship.,,
@30A773F0,"{@you}  Wow, look at that sailor's knife!",,
@31A77583,{@amy}  It was the captain's. Sounds like it went down with the ship.,,
@3EA789FA,{@you}  Hmm. I should dive again. Maybe it's still down there.,,
@30A53559,{@amy}  I've got an article about how it sank. I'll send it over!,,
@89B961FA,"{@lou}  Hey, Jules!",,
@88B96067,I'm out flying again. Weather's great today!,,
@87B95ED4,Any juicy details on that shipwreck?,,
@86B95D41,{@you}  Yes! The ship is the Loretta!,,
@85B95BAE,{@lou}  Awesome name. How'd it sink?,,
@83B95888,"{@you}  Wildfires were burning all across Wisconsin, including an awful fire in Peshtigo, Wisconsin.",,
@82B956F5,The wind blew a ton of smoke out over the lake.,,
@98D4F0FE,{@lou}   How could the captain see where he was going?,,
@99D4F291,{@you}   He couldn't. The Loretta sailed too close to shore and got stuck on a sandbar!,,
@96D4EDD8,"The sailors had to climb up into the rigging. Luckily, they were rescued by a fishing boat.",,
@97D4EF6B,{@lou}\tWow! What a wild story.,,
@9CD4F74A,Can you imagine what it was like that night?,,
@9DD4F8DD,{@you}   Yeah...,,
@A7A05B33,{@reya}\tHey sis! Ready to go treasure hunting?,,
@A6A059A0,"{@you}\tI'm not a treasure hunter, Reya.",,

@A8A05CC6,"{@reya}\tYaaaawn. Whatever floats your boat, I guess.",,
@ABA0617F,"{@reya}\tAnyway, the ship’s down there.",,
@AAA05FEC,"{@reya}\tBreak a leg! Or a flipper, or whatever.",,
@01B58D6B,{@you}\tGot it!,,
@00B58BD8,"Can you hear me through the coms, Reya? I'm diving down deeper.",,
@03B59091,"{@reya}  Copy that, sis.",,
@9E3A26AE,{@you} That's the ship! Looks like it's covered in mussels.,,
@9F3A2841,I should grab a top-down photo.,,
@7F3AC4A5,{@you}\tLooks like something crashed into the ship here.,,
@B04D8AEE,{@you}\tWow! There's an old car in the cargo area!,,
@B14D8C81,{@reya}  Huh? What's cargo?,,
@AE4D87C8,"{@you}   Oh, ""cargo"" just means the items that the ship was carrying.",,
@AF4D895B,"{@reya}  Ha. The ""cargo"" is a car that won't go! Get it??",,
@743BCFD7,{@you}\tThere's an old safe! I wonder what's inside.,,
@733BCE44,{@reya}\tA safe?! You gotta grab it!,,
@763BD2FD,"{@you}   No way, Reya. It's illegal to take anything without a permit.",,
@753BD16A,{@reya}\tUgh. You are SO BORING. I can't believe we're related.,,
@12B31512,{@you}\tI'll have a better view of that from the other side.,,
@AF02F0B7,{@you}\tThere's the cargo hatch!,,
@D80F11DE,"Hmm. Looks like part of an old car, but there's not much left.",,
@68F8E508,{@you}\tI already got a photo of this.,,
@BDC17C57,{@you}\tI should zoom in for a better shot!,,
@CD153B94,{@you}\tBetter zoom out a little.,,
@18F75054,{@you}\tI don't need a photo of this.,,
@A9177421,{@amy}\tHey! Heard you went on a dive with your sister.,,
@A6176F68,How’d it go?,,
@A71770FB,{@you}  Well... she called me boring and tried to get me in trouble.,,
@AC1778DA,But we found an amazing wreck!,,
@AD177A6D,It's a freighter near Port Washington. It was carrying old cars.,,
@AB177747,{@amy}  Hmm. Looks like two freighters sank in that area with cars onboard.,,
@A01765F6,"One with Kissel cars, and one with Nash cars.",,
@A1176789,They used to be made here in Wisconsin!,,
@3FEBB530,"{@you}   Hmm. So if I can identify the car I found, I should be able to figure out the ship!",,
@42EBB9E9,{@amy}   I've got a friend at the auto museum. I'll have him call you.,,
@41EBB856,"{@you}\tThanks, Amy!",,
@B6BE3D76,{@cooper}\tHi there! Are you Amy’s friend?,,
@B5BE3BE3,{@you}\tYep. I'm Jules Griffin.,,

@BBBE4555,{@cooper}\tOf course! Just a minute...,,
@B9BE422F,"{@you}\tAwesome, thanks!",,
@BFBE4BA1,{@cooper}     It's funny. You've got the same last name as the captain who caused that awful shipwreck.,,
@BEBE4A0E,"{@you}\tUm, yeah. I know.",,
@F37A7532,Wait... did you say the captain CAUSED the shipwreck?,,
@F47A76C5,{@cooper}\tThat's right. It was a local legend when I was a kid.,,
@F17A720C,The steel company that owned the ship said it was in great condition. The strongest freighter on the lake!,,
@F27A739F,But the captain took it out in a terrible storm.,,
@EF7A6EE6,If only he'd been more careful.,,
@F07A7079,{@you} Wow. I had no idea.,,
@ED7A6BC0,"Thanks again, Cooper.",,
@EE7A6D53,{@cooper}  Happy to help!,,
@61F4BF2A,{@amy}\tAny news on the shipwreck?,,
@62F4C0BD,"{@you}\tYep, the ship is the Madison!",,
@5FF4BC04,"{@amy}\tNice work, Jules!",,
@60F4BD97,I’ll send you the transcript of the radio distress call.,,
@5EF4BA71,"And the ship manifest, too!",,
@5CF4B74B,"{@you}\tThanks, Amy!",,
@7E36DCC7,"{@reya}\tHey, sis! Figure out that ship?",,
@7F36DE5A,"{@you}\tActually, yes. The ship is the Madison!",,
@8036DFED,{@reya}\tCool. I solved a mystery too.,,
@7A36D67B,"{@you}\tWhat?! Reya, how did you get that safe?",,
@7B36D80E,{@reya}\tThe guy who hired me got a permit to bring it up!,,
@7C36D9A1,It's just a bunch of nickels and an old alarm clock. I was hoping for gold.,,
@7536CE9C,"But they're gonna display it at a museum, with my name on it!",,
@A75DD8D5,What about the Madison? I wanna know how it sank!,,
@A65DD742,{@you}  Fine. Let's see...,,
@A55DD5AF,It was a super foggy day—the same day the stock market crashed and started the Great Depression.,,
@A45DD41C,The Madison was carrying 268 Wisconsin-made Nash cars to Detroit.,,
@A35DD289,"All of a sudden, another freighter appeared in the fog.",,
@A25DD0F6,The ships were too close to avoid crashing. The SS Lookout rammed the Madison!,,
@A15DCF63,{@reya}  Ha. Biggest car wreck ever!,,
@A05DCDD0,"{@you}\tThe captain of the Lookout panicked and headed to port, leaving the Madison behind.",,
@AF5DE56D,"Luckily, another ship came to help, but a bunch of people didn't survive.",,
@AE5DE3DA,{@reya}  Wow. That's actually a great story.,,
@AD6020DE,"Super sad, though.",,
@AE602271,I wonder if anybody saw it coming...,,
@783AA569,"{@dad}\tHey, Jules. I've got a shipwreck for you to check out!",,
@763AA243,My fishing buddy pulled this up on Lake Michigan.,,
@7B3AAA22,{@you}\tLooks like part of a sidewheel steamer!,,
@7C3AABB5,"I'll talk to my mentor, Cami. She's an expert on those ships.",,
@793AA6FC,Did you get the latitude and longitude?,,
@7A3AA88F,{@dad}\tYep. It's near Sheboygan.,,

@9D524B1B,"{@you}\tThanks, Dad.",,
@9C524988,How's the new sonar?,,
@9F524E41,{@dad}   Uh... not so great.,,
@9E524CAE,But I'm sure I'll figure it out. Eventually.,,
@A1525167,I'm out on Lake Superior right now. Got my map with me.,,
@A352548D,Your grandpa’s last planned route is marked in red.,,
@A25252FA,The Emerald must be around here somewhere.,,
@94523CF0,{@you} \tDad... why didn't you tell me the shipwreck was Grandpa's fault?,,
@0B4AA980,{@dad}  What?! Of course it wasn't his fault.,,
@0C4AAB13,{@you}  The steel company said it was.,,
@0D4AACA6,{@dad}  They just needed somebody to blame. How can you think that about your own grandpa?!,,
@0E4AAE39,"{@you}  Well, you never talk about him! What was he like?",,
@0F4AAFCC,"{@dad}  Never mind that, Jules.",,
@104AB15F,We just need to find that ship. Then you'll see.,,
@BF4CF3BA,{@cami}  Hey Jules! You need some info on a sidewheel steamer?,,
@BE4CF227,"{@you}   Yep! Thanks for calling, Cami.",,
@BD4CF094,Who's that guy with you?,,
@BC4CEF01,{@cami}  Johnny's my new diving student.,,
@BB4CED6E,He's full of awesome stories. You should chat with him sometime!,,
@BA4CEBDB,{@you}   Maybe later.,,
@B94CEA48,Have you heard of any sidewheel steamers that wrecked near Sheboygan?,,
@B84CE8B5,"{@cami} Ooh, could be the Paradise!",,
@B74CE722,"Here, check it out!",,
@B12363D1,"Gorgeous, huh? It sank in 1856.",,
@AE235F18,"People called these type of ships Palace Steamers, because they were so fancy.",,
@AF2360AB,"The manifest was lost, so the cargo is unknown.",,
@B5236A1D,"{@you}  Wow, you know a ton about this ship!",,
@B2236564,{@cami}  Yep! It's a favorite project of mine.,,
@B32366F7,Keep a lookout for the red anchor. It should have the name engraved on it.,,
@A82355A6,"{@you}  Thanks, Cami!",,
@BA952298,{@you}\tThe ship should be down there somewhere. Time to use my sonar!,,
@CFE315A2,{@you} Got it!,,
@DC30534B,{@you} Yes! It's the Paradise!,,
@DB3051B8,Can't wait to tell Cami.,,
@56833F04,{@you}\tWhoa. Are those... gold bars??,,
@57834097,Where on earth did those come from?,,
@292BF03E,{@you}  Got the cargo!,,
@2A2BF1D1,Wow... these rocking horses are more than 100 years old!,,
@778D4046,{@you}\tWhat's that written on the anchor?,,
@48281DFD,{@you}\tThat paddle wheel matches the one in Dad's photo!,,
@7F97922E,{@you} Whoa. What happened here? The ship is totally destroyed!,,
@809793C1,Looks like the engine is missing. The ship owners must've had someone bring it up from the wreck.,,
@4D6D7B92,{@you}\tI should try a different angle for a better shot,,
@5C684088,{@you}\tI already got a photo of this.,,
@894D93D7,{@you}\tI should zoom in for a better shot!,,

@6D967910,"{@cami}  When I was little, my best friend had ancestors who were lost on the Paradise.",,
@6E967AA3,It's the reason I became a maritime archaeologist.,,
@7B968F1A,It'll mean a lot to tell her we finally found it.,,

@ADF2063F,Glad I could help.,,
@6D906F73,"{@you}   Hey, Dad! Any luck finding Grandpa's ship?",,

@739078E5,"{@you}\tThe ship is a Palace Steamer, the Paradise!",,
@74907A78,{@you}\tIt was traveling past Sheboygan when a fire started in the boiler room.,,
@75907C0B,{@dad}\tYikes. Fire on a wooden ship—that's not good.,,
@BD5F2679,"{@you}\tNope. The fire spread super fast, and people panicked.",,
@BC5F24E6,One guy even jumped into a lifeboat with a bunch of heavy gold bars and broke the ropes!,,

@40CCD409,"{@you}  Wait, that's not what I meant—",,

@2984B3F9,Grandpa wrote that O.K. Steel sent him on an extra trip.,,
@2884B266,{@reya}  Um... so?,,
@2784B0D3,{@you}   There's no official record of this. It doesn't match Dad's map.,,
@2684AF40,{@dad}   Wait a sec. You mean... I've been searching the wrong part of the lake??,,
@2C84B8B2,{@reya}  Yes!!! I found a clue!!!,,

@AD20E098,I marked my grandpa's route in blue.,,

@AA20DBDF,Do you have any evidence of shipwrecks in that area?,,
@A920DA4C,"{@amy}\tHmm, let’s see...",,
@ABCB614F,A fisherman pulled up this broken piece of steel near Outer Island.,,
@ADCB6475,It could be from a freighter like your grandpa's.,,
@A6CB5970,"Location: 47°05'19.4""N 90°17'17.5""W",,
@A7CB5B03,"{@you}\tThanks, Amy!",,

@B42667B0,Dad and I will be waiting by the phone!,,

@4882D7FA,{@you} Got it!,,
@0E2BD581,{@you}\tWow. I can't believe it. We found the Emerald!,,
@0D2BD3EE,I can’t wait to tell Dad!,,

@56F7CFBC,{@you}\tThere's the crane they used for loading the cargo!,,
@698CE9A8,"{@you}\tWow, the pilot house. That would've been where Grandpa worked!",,
@D3129E31,{@you}\tLooks like the ship was carrying iron ore.,,
@4C55BF82,{@you}\tMaybe I can get a better angle. I need to show both sides of the break in the ship.,,
@53B63421,{@you}\tThe other side might have a better angle to show both parts of the ship.,,

@8B127DAA,Cami managed to track down a survivor from the Emerald!,,
@7E126933,She sent me his contact info.,,

@F38DDDB4,{@johnny} We took a skydiving class together.,,
@EA8DCF89,I had no idea she was related to the captain of the Emerald!,,
@E98DCDF6,{@you}  Yeah. My family never talks about it.,,
@004F591A,I'm trying to find out what really happened.,,
@014F5AAD,{@ed}   I wrote it all down in my journal.,,
@FF4F5787,"We were sailing smoothly when all of a sudden, there was a loud BANG.",,
@FC4F52CE,The ship had started to break in half!,,
@FD4F5461,"The captain helped launch a lifeboat. Then he tried to radio for help, but the power went out as the ship broke apart.",,
@FB4F513B,{@you}\tDid you tell anyone what happened?,,
@F84F4C82,"{@ed}   I tried, but O.K. Steel put the blame on your grandpa.",,
@F94F4E15,People said I must've remembered it wrong.,,
@7A4C4791,{@you}\tDid my grandpa ever talk about treasure?,,
@794C45FE,{@ed}\tHmm. Treasure?,,
@784C446B,"Oh, you must mean his locket! It had photos of his wife and son.",,
@774C42D8,"{@you}\tThank you, Ed. I'm sorry it took so long for someone to listen to you.",,
@7E4C4DDD,{@ed}   I always hoped the truth would come out. I'm glad you didn't give up the search.,,
@7D4C4C4A,"{@you}  Actually, it was my dad who wouldn't give up.",,
@7C4C4AB7,"{@ed}   Well, tell him thank you from me.",,
@61A541E0,{@mom}\tHey Sweetie! How'd it go out there?,,
@64A54699,{@you}   I found the Emerald!,,
@63A54506,"{@mom}   That's wonderful, Jules!",,
@66A549BF,{@you}   I still need to solve the mystery of why the ship sank.,,
@65A5482C,{@mom}   Actually... it's not such a mystery.,,
@68A54CE5,I tested the steel sample you sent me.,,
@67A54B52,It was weak and brittle. There's no way that ship could've held up against the waves.,,
@6AA5500B,{@you}   Wow. So that's why the Emerald broke apart!,,
@69A54E78,{@mom}   Yep. It was only a matter of time.,,
@87269A70,{@you}   I need to tell Dad. He was right all along.,,
@88269C03,"Thanks for your help, Mom!",,
@89269D96,"{@mom}   No problem, Sweetie.",,

@19FAD480,{@reya}  YESS!!!!,,
@1AFAD613,{@dad}   I can't believe it. After all this time.,,
@27FAEA8A,"{@you}   You were right, Dad. The wreck wasn't Grandpa's fault.",,
@28FAEC1D,"The waves were rough, but the ship was sailing smoothly.",,
@9FEE29EF,"Then there was a loud bang, and the Emerald broke in half!",,
@9EEE285C,"Grandpa helped launch a life raft, but he wasn't able to make it to safety.",,
@A1EE2D15,{@reya}   Whoa. Poor Grandpa.,,
@A0EE2B82,{@dad}   I don't understand. How can a huge freighter just break apart?,,
@9BEE23A3,{@you}   Mom found out that the ship was made of weak steel.,,
@9AEE2210,It wasn't strong enough to hold up against the waves.,,
@9DEE26C9,{@dad}   That's awful. I need to get the word out!,,
@9CEE2536,What if there are other ships in danger?,,
@A7EE3687,"{@reya}  Okay, okay, that's great and all. But what about the treasure??",,
@A6EE34F4,"{@you}   The treasure was Grandpa's locket. It had a picture of you, Dad.",,
@2DE6BAB4,{@reya}   What? That's it??,,
@2EE6BC47,"Well, at least you can get a permit and go grab it. I know you're jealous of mine.",,
@2FE6BDDA,"{@you}   Actually, I think I'll donate the locket to the museum, in Grandpa's memory.",,
@30E6BF6D,Sounds like he was an amazing captain.,,
@29E6B468,"{@dad}   Um, about that...",,
@2AE6B5FB,He was actually pretty reckless.,,
@2BE6B78E,{@you}   What?!,,
@2CE6B921,"{@dad}    Oh, yeah. A real daredevil.",,
@25E6AE1C,"{@you}  Reya, he sounds a little like you.",,
@26E6AFAF,{@reya}  I can't wait to hear more stories!,,
@33E902BD,"{@dad}   Ooh, here's a good one!",,
@32E9012A,Did I ever tell you about the time he had to climb up on the pilot house in the middle of an ice storm?,,
