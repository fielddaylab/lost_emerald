Is this Jules?

us:
Whoâ€™s this?

them:
Iâ€™m Rya. A shipwreck hunter!

them: 
Iâ€™m hunting for your grandpaâ€™s ship. Maybe Lou mentioned me?

them: 
Anyway. I was testing out my new sonar and found a wreck!

them: 
[sends coordinates and sonar image]

us: 
Thatâ€™s not my grandpaâ€™s ship.

us: 
He sank out on Superior.

them: 
Oh, I know. Just working a little side job. 

them: 
I think this might be the freighter Iâ€™m searching for!

us: 
So why donâ€™t dive down and check?

them: 
Itâ€™s too deep. I need an expert. 

them: 
Like you!! ðŸ˜‡

us: 
I guess it couldnâ€™t hurt to check it out...

them: 
Great! Race you there!
