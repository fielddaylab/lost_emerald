us: 
Hey, Rya. Thanks for the tip.

us: 
The ship was the SS Madison.

them: 
I know!!

us: 
Waitâ€¦ HOW do you know? 

them: 
Welllll.. I may have found another diver to help me out. 

them: 
By the way, check out what was in the safe!

them: 
(Sends two photos)

us: 
What?! How did you get those, Rya? 

them: 
The guy who hired me sent down a deep-sea diver to grab the safe.

them: 
Donâ€™t worry, he got a permit!

them: 
Well...I think he did. ðŸ˜‚

them: 
It was only $8 in nickels and some old chocolates. Oh well.

us: 
Rya, you canâ€™t just take stuff from ships.

them: 
Aw, come on. Youâ€™re not curious about your grandpaâ€™s treasure? 

us: 
I want to find out what happened! Itâ€™s not about the treasure.  

them: 
Ha. Sure itâ€™s not. ðŸ˜‰
